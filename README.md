The parameter index and pid hash output is used by the roto-control parameter.

If you have more than 500 parameters, you'll need to somehow parse it into two seperate debug outputs somehow. Feel free to do it and make a pull request.

This was made in an hour to help an artist wanting to manually edit their roto-control json.
